# <Title />

Composable, react-independent effects and state management.

## The rules of fusors

- any given set of `use` results should produce the same return value.
- this return value can be an actor call, in which case, the actor must cause the `use` results to change.
- hooks must be called synchronously with the fusor, and may not be called within try/catch blocks

corollaries:

- returning an effect when all your used sources are sealed is illegal
- any function passed to `memo` must be pure
