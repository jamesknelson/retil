# Running the examples

First, you'll need to clone this repository and install the project's dev dependencies. Retil uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management -- npm may work, but there are no guarantees.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jamesknelson/retil.git
cd retil
yarn install
```

Next, start an example by running `yarn start` in any of the example directories. For example:

```bash
cd examples/router-minimal
yarn install
```

Finally, open your browser at [localhost:1234](http:/localhost:1234) to try it out!
