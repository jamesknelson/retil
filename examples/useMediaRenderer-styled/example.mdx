# <Title />

The `useMediaRenderer` hook returns a function which can be used to render content only when the media query matches.

The render function should itself receive a function that will receive an argument that can be passed to your rendered element's `css` prop to hide the element using plain CSS, which is useful for server rendering.

You can see the example in action by resizing this page â€“ a different element will be rendered below based on the size of the page.

<Example />


## app.tsx

<Source filename='app.styled.tsx' />
