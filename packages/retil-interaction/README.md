==================

**Superpowers for building interactive components.**

React gave you the power of re-usable components. Retil Interactions gives you the power of re-usable *behaviors*.

- Create re-usable focus and hover indicators.
- Re-use the same styled components across your links, forms, menus, navbars, popup triggers, toggles, and other behaviors.
- Create controls which keep focus in one place, while containing many different interactive surfaces.
- Easily add smartly-positioned popups which respond to focus, hover or press events.
