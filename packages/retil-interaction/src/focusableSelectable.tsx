/**
 * Selectable surfaces are similar to focusable surfaces, but they can also be
 * configured to work through pointer or keyboard events alone, without taking
 * focus -- which can happen when used in conjuction with a focusable surface
 * with focus deletagion.
 *
 * This makes selectables useful for composite controls where focus stays in
 * an input or textarea field, while the UI presents different selectable
 * options in response to the input.
 *
 * Selectable surfaces will behave as standard surfaces unless they're rendered
 * inside a selectable context, as provided by a menu, toolbar, etc.
 *
 * Typically, selectable surfaces will also have a keyboard layer which is made
 * availble when selected, but this is left to the consumer component.
